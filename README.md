This is my Github-hosted personal site--powered by Jekyll--which you can find at [The Perfect Compromise](https://theperfectcompromise.com). It is based on [Anjuan Simmons](https://github.com/anjuan/anjuan.github.io)'s website, which is a detached fork of [Steven V. Miller's site](http://svmiller.com/), based on his [Github template](https://github.com/svmiller/steve-ngvb-jekyll-template).
