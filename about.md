Hello! Most of the content on this site explores my career in technology; if you want to know more about the man behind the URL, keep reading!

Nothing motivates more than solving problems, so much that my website is named after one of my favored approaches to it (and life, for that matter). (There's also an unhinged screed about mental models to consider if you're already that invested.) Given that life--depending on your perspective--is little more than an endless parade of problems, I feel fortunate to have such an inclination. The problem I most want to solve: belonging.

The proliferation of remote work--which I love--has hastened the disappearance of third places, robbing more people of a potential place to belong. Between that, the rising cost of living, and other factors, the epidemic of loneliness is afflicting an ever-increasing number of people; no amount of scrolling or pharmaceutical intervention will fix it. (Those of you familiar with Simon Sinek probably know where this is going.) It is more important than ever to make the workplace--one place most people must go in some capacity--less adversarial and more likely to engender a sense of belonging.

I want to reform the workplace by leading people therein to experience a community built upon mutual trust, collaboration, and the unfettered flow of information--and the innovation such an environment produces. I can realize this by solving problems in a way that positively impacts people and outcomes around me--through conscientiousness and healthy relationships built upon transparency, vulnerability, humility, and integrity.

If any of that resonates with you or you have questions, feel free to [contact me](/contact/). I would love to connect and learn more about you.
